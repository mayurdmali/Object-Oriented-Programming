OOP-Based Student Management System in Java
This Java OOP project implements a Student Management System using three main components:

1. Student Entity Class: Defines student attributes (name, roll, div, course, fees) with getters, setters, and a display method.
2. StudentService Class: Manages operations like adding, removing, and fetching students using a list.
3. StudentTest Class: Tests the system by creating students, performing operations, and displaying results.

The project follows OOP principles such as encapsulation ensuring a clean and scalableÂ structure.
